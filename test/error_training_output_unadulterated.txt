Running Error-training DADA2 on 2 samples with omega = 1e-300
Saving model to trainingDADA.rds
Graphing the LOWESS-regressed error model. Generally observed Phred error rates exceed expectation (red) by 2-3 fold.

Error training Summary for omega = 1e-300
The mean size of the largest cluster is 100%.
This cluster should dominate (i.e. exceed 95% of the total) as, ideally, there is only 1 training cluster.
Estimated a total error rate of 0.3920% (0.1 - 0.5% is typical.) By Phred Score:
Phred Range | Error Rate | LOWESS-Average | Millions of Nucleotides in Range
